    "# **1. Business Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Project Overview**\n",
    "A Sales and Inventory Forecasting System was developed to help retail and product-driven businesses anticipate future demand, optimize stock levels, and support strategic decision-making. Accurate forecasting enables improved budgeting, efficient purchasing cycles, and prevention of operational risks such as stock-outs and overstocking. By analyzing historical sales and inventory movement over an 18-month period, the system identifies patterns, detects seasonality, and predicts future behavior across hundreds of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1.1 Business Problem**\n",
    "Retail operations frequently encounter uncertainty in customer demand, fluctuating sales volumes, and inconsistent supplier lead times. Without data-driven forecasting, businesses may face:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stock-outs during high-demand periods  \n",
    "- Overstocking that ties up capital and increases storage costs  \n",
    "- Poor financial planning and inaccurate budgeting  \n",
    "- Reduced ability to respond to market changes  \n",
    "\n",
    "A forecasting system provides visibility into future demand and stock requirements, reducing operational risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1.2 Project Objectives**\n",
    "The forecasting system is designed to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predict monthly sales for each product  \n",
    "- Forecast revenue trends across the business  \n",
    "- Estimate future inventory requirements  \n",
    "- Identify products at risk of depletion or overstocking  \n",
    "- Support budgeting, procurement planning, and operational strategy  \n",
    "\n",
    "These objectives ensure that sales performance, stock movement, and purchasing decisions are aligned with future expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1.3 Key Business Questions**\n",
    "The system aims to answer several critical operational and financial questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the expected sales levels over the next 3, 6, and 12 months?  \n",
    "- Which products are experiencing growth or decline?  \n",
    "- When will current stock fall below reorder thresholds?  \n",
    "- How much inventory should be replenished, and when?  \n",
    "- Which suppliers contribute to delays due to long lead times?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Answering these questions strengthens both operational decision-making and financial forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1.4 Success Criteria**\n",
    "The project is considered successful if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Forecasting accuracy meets acceptable business thresholds  \n",
    "  (for example, MAPE < 20%, depending on product behavior)  \n",
    "- Sales, revenue, and stock forecasts are clear and actionable  \n",
    "- Operational users can identify inventory risks early  \n",
    "- A dashboard enables leaders to visualize trends and predictions  \n",
    "- The forecasting results support data-driven procurement and budgeting  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Highlights**\n",
    "- End-to-end forecasting pipeline covering sales, revenue, and inventory  \n",
    "- 18 months of synthetic but realistic daily transactional data  \n",
    "- Multi-table relational database reflecting real business operations  \n",
    "- Forecasts support strategic planning, purchasing, and stock control  \n",
    "- Designed for scalability to hundreds of products and multiple suppliers  \n"

    "# **3. Data Preparation**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Overview**\n",
    "This stage establishes the structured foundation used for analysis, forecasting, and dashboard development. It involves creating the relational database schema, generating synthetic but realistic datasets, enforcing data quality standards, and transforming the raw data into analytical formats. A clean, well-organized dataset ensures that forecasting models receive accurate and consistent input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3.1 Creating the Database Structure**\n",
    "A complete relational database schema is prepared to support sales forecasting, inventory planning, and supplier performance analysis. Four main tables are constructed:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **A. Products Table**\n",
    "Defines foundational product characteristics, including:\n",
    "- Category and brand information  \n",
    "- SKU codes and physical attributes  \n",
    "- Pricing and lifecycle status  \n",
    "- Supplier linkage  \n",
    "\n",
    "This table enables product-level forecasting and inventory evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **B. Sales Table**\n",
    "Stores granular daily sales transactions across an 18-month period.  \n",
    "Attributes include:\n",
    "- Quantities sold  \n",
    "- Sales price at time of transaction  \n",
    "- Revenue and profit calculations  \n",
    "- Customer, region, payment method, and channel identifiers  \n",
    "- Promotion and discount usage  \n",
    "\n",
    "This table is the primary source for demand analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **C. Inventory Table**\n",
    "Represents product-level inventory conditions with:\n",
    "- Current stock  \n",
    "- Safety levels  \n",
    "- Lead times  \n",
    "- Restock dates  \n",
    "- Warehouse capacity metrics  \n",
    "\n",
    "This table is used to evaluate inventory health and predict stock depletion.\n",
    "\n",

    "Captures supplier performance with:\n",
    "- Lead time behavior  \n",
    "- Delivery reliability  \n",
    "- Country of origin  \n",
    "- Supplier contact details  \n",
    "\n",
    "This supports inventory optimization and restocking logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3.2 Cleaning and Validating Source Data**\n",
    "Before loading data for modeling, several quality checks are performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **A. Column Type Verification**\n",
    "- Dates converted to valid date formats  \n",
    "- Prices stored as numeric values  \n",
    "- Categorical entries standardized (e.g., payment methods, regions, channels)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **B. Removing Irregularities**\n",
    "- Invalid or impossible dates  \n",
    "- Negative quantities  \n",
    "- Inconsistent pricing or discounts  \n",
    "- Missing or mismatched product references  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **C. Ensuring Referential Integrity**\n",
    "To maintain a reliable relational structure:\n",
    "- Every `Sales.product_id` must exist in `Products`  \n",
    "- Every `Inventory.product_id` must exist in `Products`  \n",
    "- Every `Products.supplier_id` must correspond to a record in `Suppliers`  \n",
    "\n",
    "Maintaining strict integrity ensures accurate joins and prevents misleading results during analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3.3 Transforming Sales Data for Forecasting**\n",
    "Raw daily transactions are not directly used for forecasting. They must be aggregated and reshaped into structured time-series datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **A. Converting Daily Sales → Monthly Sales**\n",
    "Daily-level data is grouped into monthly totals for each product:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aggregated Metrics**\n",
    "- Total monthly quantity sold  \n",

    "- Number of monthly transactions  \n",
    "- Average monthly discount  \n",
    "- Dominant sales region  \n",
    "- Promotion activity indicators  \n",
    "\n",
    "Monthly-level formatting simplifies forecasting and captures broader trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **B. Filling Missing Months**\n",
    "In time-series forecasting, each product must have:\n",
    "- A continuous sequence of months  \n",
    "- No gaps in the timeline  \n",
    "- Zero-sales months recorded explicitly  \n",
    "\n",
    "Missing periods are filled to ensure uniform modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **C. Creating Modeling Tables**\n",
    "Several structured modeling datasets are produced:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. `monthly_sales`**\n",
    "Includes:\n",
    "- `product_id`  \n",
    "- `year_month`  \n",
    "- Monthly quantity, revenue, profit  \n",
    "- Discount and promotion indicators  \n",
    "- Region dominance  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. `monthly_inventory_snapshot`**\n",
    "Includes:\n",
    "- Starting and ending monthly stock  \n",
    "- Lead times  \n",
    "- Stock-out flags  \n",
    "- Inventory turnover metrics  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. `product_master`**\n",
    "A consolidated reference table including:\n",
    "- Category, brand, SKU codes  \n",
    "- Cost and selling price  \n",
    "- Supplier information  \n",
    "- Physical attributes  \n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets serve as the primary inputs for feature engineering and forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3.4 Data Quality Assessment Before Modeling**\n",
    "Before advancing to feature engineering and modeling, the prepared datasets undergo several checks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Confirm that all products have continuous 18-month timelines  \n",
    "- Verify that aggregated monthly sales align with daily totals  \n",
    "- Detect outliers or extreme spikes in demand  \n",
    "- Confirm no missing product or supplier references  \n",
    "- Validate the range and distribution of prices, discounts, and quantities  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ensuring quality at this stage reduces model errors and increases forecasting accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Highlights**\n",
    "- Fully structured relational schema reflecting real retail operations  \n",
    "- Cleaned and validated synthetic datasets ensuring reliability  \n",
    "- Daily sales transformed into monthly analytical formats  \n",
    "- Missing months filled for stable time-series forecasting  \n",
    "- Modeling-ready datasets created for product-level and category-level analysis  \n"
