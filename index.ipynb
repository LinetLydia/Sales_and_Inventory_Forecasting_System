    "# Business Understanding\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to build a system that can **accurately forecast future sales and inventory needs** to support **budgeting, purchasing, and strategic planning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Business Problem**\n",
    "Retail and product-based businesses must **anticipate future sales** to:\n",
    "- **Plan inventory levels**\n",
    "- **Avoid stock-outs**\n",
    "- **Prevent overstocking**\n",
    "- **Improve budgeting and financial forecasting**\n",
    "\n",
    "Without forecasting, the business risks:\n",
    "- **Running out of stock** during demand peaks  \n",
    "- **Holding too much inventory**, tying up cash  \n",
    "- **Poor financial planning** and delayed decisions  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Objectives**\n",
    "This project aims to:\n",
    "- **Forecast monthly sales** for each product  \n",
    "- **Forecast monthly revenue**  \n",
    "- **Predict future inventory requirements**  \n",
    "- **Identify products at risk of low stock / stock-out**  \n",
    "- **Support budgeting and strategic planning** using predictive analytics  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Key Business Questions**\n",
    "The forecasting system should answer:\n",
    "- **What will sales look like in the next 3, 6, and 12 months?**  \n",
    "- **Which products are growing or declining?**  \n",
    "- **When will current stock fall below reorder level?**  \n",
    "- **How much inventory will be needed in the coming months?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Success Criteria**\n",
    "The project is successful if:\n",
    "- **Forecasting accuracy is acceptable**  \n",
    "  (e.g., **MAPE < X%** depending on business tolerance)\n",
    "- **Insights are clear and actionable** for both finance and operations  \n",
    "- A **dashboard** is created to visualize sales trends, future predictions, and inventory risks  \n",
    "- The system **supports budgeting, purchasing decisions, and financial planning**  \n"
