    "# **1. Business Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Project Overview**\n",
    "A Sales and Inventory Forecasting System was developed to help retail and product-driven businesses anticipate future demand, optimize stock levels, and support strategic decision-making. Accurate forecasting enables improved budgeting, efficient purchasing cycles, and prevention of operational risks such as stock-outs and overstocking. By analyzing historical sales and inventory movement over an 18-month period, the system identifies patterns, detects seasonality, and predicts future behavior across hundreds of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1.1 Business Problem**\n",
    "Retail operations frequently encounter uncertainty in customer demand, fluctuating sales volumes, and inconsistent supplier lead times. Without data-driven forecasting, businesses may face:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stock-outs during high-demand periods  \n",
    "- Overstocking that ties up capital and increases storage costs  \n",
    "- Poor financial planning and inaccurate budgeting  \n",
    "- Reduced ability to respond to market changes  \n",
    "\n",
    "A forecasting system provides visibility into future demand and stock requirements, reducing operational risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1.2 Project Objectives**\n",
    "The forecasting system is designed to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predict monthly sales for each product  \n",
    "- Forecast revenue trends across the business  \n",
    "- Estimate future inventory requirements  \n",
    "- Identify products at risk of depletion or overstocking  \n",
    "- Support budgeting, procurement planning, and operational strategy  \n",
    "\n",
    "These objectives ensure that sales performance, stock movement, and purchasing decisions are aligned with future expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1.3 Key Business Questions**\n",
    "The system aims to answer several critical operational and financial questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the expected sales levels over the next 3, 6, and 12 months?  \n",
    "- Which products are experiencing growth or decline?  \n",
    "- When will current stock fall below reorder thresholds?  \n",
    "- How much inventory should be replenished, and when?  \n",
    "- Which suppliers contribute to delays due to long lead times?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Answering these questions strengthens both operational decision-making and financial forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1.4 Success Criteria**\n",
    "The project is considered successful if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Forecasting accuracy meets acceptable business thresholds  \n",
    "  (for example, MAPE < 20%, depending on product behavior)  \n",
    "- Sales, revenue, and stock forecasts are clear and actionable  \n",
    "- Operational users can identify inventory risks early  \n",
    "- A dashboard enables leaders to visualize trends and predictions  \n",
    "- The forecasting results support data-driven procurement and budgeting  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Highlights**\n",
    "- End-to-end forecasting pipeline covering sales, revenue, and inventory  \n",
    "- 18 months of synthetic but realistic daily transactional data  \n",
    "- Multi-table relational database reflecting real business operations  \n",
    "- Forecasts support strategic planning, purchasing, and stock control  \n",
    "- Designed for scalability to hundreds of products and multiple suppliers  \n"
