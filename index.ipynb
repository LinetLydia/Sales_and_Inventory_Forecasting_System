    "- **Avoid stock-outs**\n",
    "- **Prevent overstocking**\n",
    "- **Improve budgeting and financial forecasting**\n",
    "\n",
    "Without forecasting, the business risks:\n",
    "- **Running out of stock** during demand peaks  \n",
    "- **Holding too much inventory**, tying up cash  \n",

    "- **Predict future inventory requirements**  \n",
    "- **Identify products at risk of low stock / stock-out**  \n",
    "- **Support budgeting and strategic planning** using predictive analytics  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Key Business Questions**\n",
    "The forecasting system should answer:\n",
    "- **What will sales look like in the next 3, 6, and 12 months?**  \n",
    "- **Which products are growing or declining?**  \n",
    "- **When will current stock fall below reorder level?**  \n",
    "- **How much inventory will be needed in the coming months?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Success Criteria**\n",
    "The project is successful if:\n",
    "- **Forecasting accuracy is acceptable**  \n",
    "  (e.g., **MAPE < X%** depending on business tolerance)\n",
    "- **Insights are clear and actionable** for both finance and operations  \n",
    "- A **dashboard** is created to visualize sales trends, future predictions, and inventory risks  \n",
    "- The system **supports budgeting, purchasing decisions, and financial planning**  \n"

    "# Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses a rich, multi-dimensional dataset that simulates real-world retail operations.  \n",
    "The goal is to build a forecasting system capable of predicting future sales, revenue, and inventory needs.  \n",
    "To achieve this, multiple tables are designed with detailed attributes that support analytics, forecasting, and operational insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Identify Data Sources / Tables**\n",
    "\n",
    "We work with four main tables: **Products, Sales, Inventory, Suppliers.**  \n",
    "Each contains detailed columns to mimic realistic business datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Products Table (Expanded Attributes)**  \n",
    "Contains core product information for forecasting, pricing, and inventory planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Columns include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- product_id (PK)  \n",
    "- product_name  \n",
    "- category  \n",
    "- brand  \n",
    "- sku_code  \n",
    "- cost_price  \n",
    "- selling_price  \n",
    "- weight_kg  \n",
    "- dimensions  \n",
    "- launch_date  \n",
    "- discontinued (0/1)\n",
    "\n",
    "These attributes allow advanced analysis such as product lifecycle, profitability, and category-level forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Sales Table (Highly Detailed Transaction Data)**  \n",
    "Contains every sales transaction with additional operational, customer, and pricing dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Columns include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- sale_id (PK)  \n",
    "- product_id (FK → Products)  \n",
    "- sale_date  \n",
    "- quantity_sold  \n",
    "- selling_price_at_time  \n",
    "- revenue  \n",
    "- profit  \n",
    "- customer_type (retail, wholesale, online, store)  \n",
    "- region (e.g., Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu...)  \n",
    "- payment_method (cash, mpesa, card, transfer)  \n",
    "- discount_applied  \n",
    "- order_channel (website, store, app)  \n",
    "- promotion_flag (0/1)\n",
    "\n",
    "This table is critical for understanding demand, seasonality, price effects, customer mix, and regional patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Inventory Table (Operational Inventory Data)**  \n",
    "Contains detailed stock status and logistics-related attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Columns include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- product_id (FK → Products)  \n",
    "- current_stock  \n",
    "- reorder_level  \n",
    "- safety_stock  \n",
    "- lead_time_days  \n",
    "- last_restock_date  \n",
    "- warehouse_location  \n",
    "- max_capacity  \n",
    "- stock_value\n",
    "\n",
    "This supports forecasting future inventory needs, flagging risks, and planning replenishment cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Suppliers Table (Optional but Realistic)**  \n",
    "Provides external sourcing information for products.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Columns include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- supplier_id (PK)  \n",
    "- supplier_name  \n",
    "- contact_email  \n",
    "- country  \n",
    "- delivery_lead_time_days  \n",
    "- reliability_score\n",

    "\n",
    "The database structure forms a clean relational model:\n",

    "- **Products.product_id → Sales.product_id**  \n",
    "  (Each product has many sales)\n",

    "  (Each product has one inventory record)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Suppliers.supplier_id → Products.supplier_id**  \n",
    "  (Each product has one supplier)\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure supports complex joins for forecasting, trend analysis, and inventory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## **3. Initial Data Exploration**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the synthetic dataset is generated, we will perform:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **A. Date Range Checks**\n",
    "- Identify the earliest and latest sale dates  \n",
    "- Confirm the dataset spans the full 3-year period  \n",
    "- Ensure no gaps in date continuity\n",
    "\n",
    "### **B. Row Counts**\n",
    "- Products: ~10–20  \n",
    "- Inventory: same number of products  \n",
    "- Suppliers: 3–6  \n",
    "- **Sales: 3,000+ entries (random, messy, no pattern)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **C. Sample Previews**\n",
    "Examine first few rows from each table to verify:\n",
    "- Column names and data types  \n",
    "- Correct foreign key mappings  \n",
    "- Realistic pricing, quantities, and profit values  \n",
    "- Random distribution of customer types, regions, payments\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Understand Sales Frequency & Patterns**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the dataset is synthetic but randomly generated, we verify:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sales occur **daily or randomly** across the timeline  \n",
    "- Each product exhibits **unique demand patterns**  \n",
    "- Seasonal boosts (e.g., holidays, mid-year sales) if applied  \n",
    "- Variability in regions, customer types, and discounts\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these helps choose appropriate forecasting models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Potential Data Issues to Watch For**\n",
    "\n",
    "Even synthetic datasets can highlight real business challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing dates**  \n",
    "- **Sudden spikes or dips** in sales  \n",
    "- **Products with extremely low activity** (hard to forecast)  \n",
    "- **Zero-sales months**  \n",
    "- **Unusual discounts or promotions**  \n",
    "- **Inventory levels far below demand**  \n",
    "- **Lead times that are too long or too short**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying these early helps improve forecasting accuracy and business interpretation.\n",
